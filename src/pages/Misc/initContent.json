					"There are four rounds for each Prevailing Wind (East, South, West, North), and everyone takes turn to be the dealer as the game progresses.",

					"The points of each hand depends on the tiles it contains, and there are three main ways to gain points:<ul><li>Melding Dragon tiles, the Prevailing/Seat Winds</li><li>Having bonus tiles (see the Tiles section)</li><li>Certain combinations of melds/tiles (see the Scoring Hands section)</li></ul>",
					"Players can only Hu (win) when they form a complete hand of 4 melds and a pair (eyes), or have a special combination of tiles, and their hand meets the minimum Tai (points) required.",
