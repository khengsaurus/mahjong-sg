					"There are four rounds for each Prevailing Wind (East, South, West, North), and everyone takes turn to be the dealer as the game progresses.",
					"The dealer starts with 14 tiles and is the first to discard.",
					"The objective of the game is to form 'Melds', which can either be three consecutive tiles (Chi) or three or four of a kind (Pong/Kang).",

					"Players can only take tiles discarded by player's to their left to Chi, but can take any discarded tile to Pong, Kang, or Hu (win). Note that:<ul><li>Hu has priority over Pong/Kang and Chi</li><li>Pong/Kang has priority over Chi.</li></ul>",
					"The points of each hand depends on the tiles it contains, and there are three main ways to gain points:<ul><li>Melding Dragon tiles, the Prevailing/Seat Winds</li><li>Having bonus tiles (see the Tiles section)</li><li>Certain combinations of melds/tiles (see the Scoring Hands section)</li></ul>",
					"Players can only Hu (win) when they form a complete hand of 4 melds and a pair (eyes), or have a special combination of tiles, and their hand meets the minimum Tai (points) required.",
					"If the dealer Hu's, the game will not proceed to the next round and the current dealer will be the dealer for the next round too.",
					"If there are 15 tiles left and the last player to draw does not Hu, the round is drawn. If so, the game will only proceed to the next round if there was a Kang or someone drew matching bonus tiles."
